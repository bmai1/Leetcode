generalized binary search template

def binary_search(array) -> int:
    def condition(value) -> bool:
        pass

    left, right = 0, len(array)
    while left < right:
        mid = left + (right - left) // 2
        if condition(mid):
            right = mid
        else:
            left = mid + 1
    return left

- setup left right boundary to include all elements
- decide return value (left is minimal k satisfying condition)
- design conditional to adjust left right
