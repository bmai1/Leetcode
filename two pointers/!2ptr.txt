Really bad habit of TLE'ing with two pointers on a sliding window problem
Similar to:

for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    for (int j = i; j < n; ++j) {
        // do stuff, usually with another loop
    }
}

!! THIS IS NOT THE TWO POINTERS APPROACH, THAT IS BRUTE FORCE!!

- Two pointers iterate through array (pt to first and last index of subarray), each moving one direction

- Subarray Sum: 
On each turn, the left pointer moves one step to the right, 
right pointer moves to the right as long as the resulting subarray sum is at most x
If the sum becomes exactly x, a solution has been found.
