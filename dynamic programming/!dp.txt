DP (65)
Uses: optimal solution (x∗), count number of solutions
- recursive formulation such that subproblem solutions lead to final solution
- memoize after calculation -> reconstruct x∗, count n solutions

- states: variables to memoize
- transitions: how to use prior values to get curr value

- Coin Problem
- Longest Increasing Subsequence
